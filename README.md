# Tamagui Expo Starter
This is a starter template for [Expo](https://expo.dev) using [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev).
In this template you get out of the box:
- I18n (WIP)
- Light and Dark Themes
- Expo Dev Client ready
- Semantic Release already configured with everything you might want
- EAS (Expo Application Services) profiles already configured
- Different icons for different app types (Dev Client, Beta and Production)

## Before you run...
1. Build the dev client with `eas build -p android --profile development`
1. If you're in WSL, use the `yarn wsl` command, else `yarn start` is your default choice. Don't forget to add `--dev-client` to it.
